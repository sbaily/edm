	2014-11-04 Murali Shankar dae32dc Moved over mmover from custom EDM deployments for Garth.
	2014-10-13 Murali Shankar 945de93 Added the bar widget from edm-R1-12-56-lcls1 as activeSlacBarClass to slacLib This previous version has some optimizations that were pulled out from later releases. This change seems to affect the LCLS fastBPM screens in terms of a flicker. Using double buffering in the fastEDM screen helps with the flickering but consumes way too much horsepower on the Sunrays in MCC So, Murali and Mike Z copied over the edm-R1-12-56-lcls1 version of this widget and added it as activeSlacBarClass in SLAClib
	2014-09-16 Murali Shankar 65fda7b Add mzXyGraph to the registries as well
	2014-09-16 Murali Shankar aaa4c5d Add mzxygraph to makefile
	2014-09-05 Murali Shankar 0bf6539 Added a copy of xygraph from baselib with HOPR/LOPR monitors for Mike Z. The intent is to test this for a while in production and then see if we can incorporate the changes back into baselib. I have also add the original xygraph.h and xygraph.cc into this folder to faciliate 3way merges.

R1.12.105A-1.0.0	2017-04-29	Bruce Hill
	Fix build error for 32 bit linux from 64 bit host. Prior code overwrote OP_SYS_LDFLAGS for a old solaris only issue. Made it conditional for OS_CLASS solaris.
	ifdef'd lib/app_pkg.cc,h for NO_UNORDERED_MAP so we can build on rhel5
	Moved SHARED_LIBRARIES and STATIC_BUILD definition to configure/CONFIG_EDM
	Moved CXXFLAGS config to edm configure/CONFIG* files
	Consolidating EDM configuration in new edm configure/CONFIG_EDM and CONFIG_SITE* files
	Updated edm PV classes to support variable sized arrays over CA
	Made hash functions for Hashtable templates be static T::hash() to compile w/ gcc 4.8.5
	Changed all strncpy calls to Strncpy to guarantee terminated strings
	Added new Strncpy() routine, similar to Strncat() for consistent buffer management. Always terminates the new string.
	Bumped userLib, curPath, and colorPath arrays from 127 to MAX_DIR, currently 256. Replaced inconsistent use of hard coded 127 and 255 length values w/ MAX_DIR.
	Fixed narrowing warnings
